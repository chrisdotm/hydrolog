# Basil Grow log
## Dates Unknown
Basic was started by soaking seads for approximately 3 hours before moving to wet paper towel [method](Methodology). These grew what looks like a sticky gel around the seed in that short period of time. They were very quick to sprout from there.

Moved these to seed starter tray as leaves finally started to appear. I did plant them a little deeper than I intended, leaves were under the coco.

## 11/14/20
Leaves are visible over the coco, will be interesting to see speed of growth as I'v been told basic grows like a weed.
