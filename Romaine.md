# Romaine Lettuce Grow log
## Dates unknown
I had a seed packed marked best by 2018, and decided to give these a go. I was able to successfully sprout roughly 8 of these, of those I currently have 1 plant with leaves as of 11/14/2020 (Started these roughly 11/1/2020). To sprout, I've been going with the simple wet paper towel [method](Methodology). 

## 11/14/2020
Moved 1 lettuce plant from [seed starter](https://amzn.to/2Kb9sBx) to [small hydro bed](https://amzn.to/3kvjSbG), which I intend to have as it's final home. Currently under light set to veg mode. 2 leaves haves formed with a 3rd leaf appearing over the last 24 hours. PH of water is roughly 6.3, added seaweed based nutrient.

## 11/30/2020
Upped nutrient levels in smaller hydro bed. Also moveed 5 sprouted seeed to the seed starter.

## 12/1/2020
