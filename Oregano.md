# Oregano Grow log
## Dates unknown
I already had some organo seeds from 2018, I fear those seeds are no longer viable. I did however get new seeds in the set purchased from [amazon](https://amzn.to/35yYz4N). I started these the same as all the other 3 hour soak, followed by storage in ziplock bag filled with wet paper towel. These sat for days with absolutely no movement.

Moved these into tent, they remained on  top of 45W light for heat.

This morning the newer seeds basically exploded to life, growing roughly half inch sprouts out of the paper towel. I moved these to seedling starters and kept under 24 hour light.
