# Tomato Grow log 
## Dates unknown
I ordered these seeds from amazon, link is no longer valid so I won't share here. However [methodology](Methodology) for sprouting was soaking seeds for roughly 3 hours before moving to wet paper towel and heat. I believe I had a 100 yield from the seeds I soaked. They were moved to seedling starters with coco soil. These sat out in the open for a few days under artificial light. Very little change over a few days

Moved these (still in seed starter) into tent. These plants are doing the best out of everything I've started so far. 2 leaves each roughly half inch long and a hairy stem. These are already starting to look as you would expect for a tomato plant.

I definitely germinated too many of these and am going to end up having to get rid of more than half. I did for now though move 5 of these plants into their next home. PH of water is roughly 6.3, added seaweed based nutrient. Noted growth over this period is the stem looks longer than the day before and leaves have opened on the last one that was still somewhat stuck in its seed.
