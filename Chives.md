# Chives Grow log
## Dates Unknown
Chives were started by soaking seads for approximately 3 hours before moving to wet paper towel [method](Methodology). 

## 11/14/20
This morning I found that 1 seed of the 2 I'm attempting to start had roots coming from the seed. I moved that to the seedling starter tray (probably premature as there were no leaves yet). I'll be keeping an eye on it's progress.
