# Parsley Grow log
## Dates unknown
Parsley was started by soaking seads for approximately 3 hours before moving to wet paper towel [method](Methodology). These have yet to sprout, but I think are still within reason for future sprouting. I may attempt a longer soaking on 2 more seeds if these haven't had any change in the next few days.  (Started these roughly 11/1/2020)
