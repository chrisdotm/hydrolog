# Brussel Sprouts Grow log

## Dates unknown
I ordered these seeds from amazon, link is no longer valid so I won't share here. However [methodology](Methodology) for sprouting was soaking seeds for roughly 3 hours before moving to wet paper towel and heat. I believe I had a 100 yield from the seeds I soaked. They were moved to seedling starters with coco soil. These sat out in the open for a few days under artificial light. Very little change over a few days.

Moved these (still in seed starter) into tent.

There was a definite growth over 24 hours, didn't measure so can't be sure how much. I did however decide it was time to move 3 of the 4 into their next home. These are currently in the larger side of the tent occupying 3 of the 11 spaces. I'll make judgement as they get bigger on which 2 will move into 5 gallon buckets. PH of water is roughly 6.3, added seaweed based nutrient.
